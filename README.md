# Summaries-on-AI-topics
Collection of Summaries for the research module *Agent-Technology/Current Topics of Computational Intelligence* at the University of Potsdam in the winter-semester 2019/2020.

The Summaries refer to a programming paradigm called [Answer Set Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_set_programming). 
The main concepts are introduced in [Answer Set Solvers and the Basics of Answer Sets](https://github.com/bmarv/Summaries-on-AI-topics/blob/master/1.%20Answer%20Set%20Solvers%20and%20the%20Basics%20of%20Answer%20Sets.pdf).

Various Topics are studied including *Knowledge Representation, Reasoning, Grounding and Solving, Timetabling, Planning with Multiple Agents, Automatic Music Composition, AI based Game Design, Semantic Parsing, Bioinformatics Problems* and as a final Paper [Automatic Trance Music Generation and Automatic Melodic Variation as Aesthetic Music](https://github.com/bmarv/Summaries-on-AI-topics/blob/master/Paper%20-%20Automatic%20Trance%20Music%20Generation%20and%20Automatic%20Melodic%20Variation%20as%20Aesthetic%20Music.pdf) as well as the coherent [Presentation](https://github.com/bmarv/Summaries-on-AI-topics/blob/master/Presentation%20-%20Automatic%20Trance%20Music%20Generation%20and%20Automatic%20Melodic%20Variation%20as%20Aesthetic%20Music.pdf).
